that receives salary of an employee and returns the level of the salary.        
If salary is < 30000, return "Low"        
If salary is between 30000 and 50000 (inclusive), return "Average"        
If salary is > 50000, return "High"
###### Example  
  Salary    Salary Level  
  13500.00  Low
  43300.00  Average
  125500.00  High
  
### 6. Employees by Salary Level

Create a stored procedure usp_EmployeesBySalaryLevel that receives as parameter level of salary (low, average,
or high) and print the names of all employees, who have the
given level of salary. You should use the
function - "dbo.ufn_GetSalaryLevel(@Salary)", which was part of the previous
task, inside your "CREATE PROCEDURE …" query.
###### Example
Here is the list of all employees with a high salary.
 
  First Name  Last Name
  Terri  Duffy  
  Jean  Trenary
  Ken  Sanchez
  …
  …
  
### 7. Define Function
Define a function ufn_IsWordComprised(@setOfLetters, @word) that returns true or false, 
depending on that if the word is comprised of the given set of letters.

  bobr    Rob     1
  pppp  Guy  0
  
### 8. Delete Employees and Departments
Create a procedure with the name usp_DeleteEmployeesFromDepartment (@departmentId INT) which deletes all Employees from a given department. Delete these departments from the Departments table too. Finally, SELECT the number of employees from the given department. If the delete statements are correct the select
query should return 0.
After completing that exercise restore your database to revert all changes.
Hint:
You may set ManagerID column in Departments table to nullable (using query "ALTER TABLE …").

## Part II – Queries for Bank Database

### 9. Find Full Name
You are given a database schema with tables AccountHolders(Id (PK), FirstName, LastName, SSN) and Accounts(Id (PK), AccountHolderId (FK), Balance).  Write a stored
procedure usp_GetHoldersFullName that selects the full name of all people. 
###### Example
  
  Full Name
  Susan
  Cane
  Kim Novac
  Jimmy Henderson
  …
### 10. People with Balance Higher Than
Your task is to create a stored procedure usp_GetHoldersWithBalanceHigherThan that accepts a number as a parameter and
returns all the people, who have more money in total in all their accounts than the supplied number. Order them by their first name, then by their last name.
###### Example  
  First Name  Last Name
  Monika  Miteva
  Petar  Kirilov
  …  …
### 11. Future Value Function
Your task is to create a function ufn_CalculateFutureValue that accepts as parameters – sum (decimal), yearly interest rate (float), and the number of years (int). It should calculate and return the future value of the initial sum rounded up to the fourth digit after the decimal delimiter. Use the following formula:
I – Initial sum        
R – Yearly interest rate        
T – Number of yearsExample
  Input              Output
  Initial sum: 1000 1610.5100
  Yearly Interest
  rate: 10%
  years: 5
  ufn_CalculateFutureValue(1000, 0.1, 5)
### 12. Calculating Interest
Your task is to create a stored procedure usp_CalculateFutureValueForAccount that uses the function from the previous problem to give an interest to a person's account for 5 years, along with information about their account id, first name, last name and current balance as it is shown in the example below. It should take the AccountId and the interest rate as parameters. Again, you are provided with the dbo.ufn_CalculateFutureValue function, which was part of the previous task.
###### Example
  Account Id  First Name  Last Name  Current Balance    Balance in 5 years
  1  Susan  Cane  123.12  198.2860
*Note: for the example above interest rate is 0.1

## Part III – Queries for Diablo Database
You are given a database "Diablo" holding users, games, items, characters and statistics, available as an SQL script. Your task is to write some stored procedures, views, and other server-side database objects and write some SQL queries for displaying the data from the database.
Important: start with a clean copy of the "Diablo" database on each problem. Just execute the SQL script again.

### 13. *Scalar Function: Cash in User
Games Odd Rows
Create a function ufn_CashInUsersGames that sums the cash of the odd rows. Rows must be ordered by cash in descending order. The function should take a game name as a parameter and return the result as a table. Submit only your function in. Execute the function over the following game names, ordered exactly like: "Love in a mist".
Output 
  SumCash
  8585.00
Hint
Use ROW_NUMBER to get the
rankings of all rows based on order criteria.
